# bbin-site

Source code for the bbin site.

This is a static site built with [Rain](https://github.com/rads/rain). If you have a tool you'd like to be included on the site, just add the `bbin` tag to your repo on GitHub.

The list of repositories is updated every five minutes via GitHub Actions. The job searches for the `bbin` tag on GitHub and scrapes the [Scripts and Projects](https://github.com/babashka/bbin/wiki/Scripts-and-Projects) wiki page to find results. 

## Getting Started

```shell
bb dev
```
